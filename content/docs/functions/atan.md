Returns the arctangent of a certain value.

This function performs an arctangent calculation on a certain value and returns an [angle]({{< ref "/docs/variables/angle" >}}) between but not including -90000 and 90000 (-90-90ยบ).

## Parameters

- FLOAT value - The value to be performed an arctangent calculation on.

## Returns

FLOAT : The arctangent result of the specified value, an angle between but not including -90000 and 90000 (-90-90ยบ).

## Notes

The angle value returned by this function is in thousandths of degrees, as most angles within Bennu are.
