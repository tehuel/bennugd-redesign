A constant is a container containing a [value]({{< ref "value" >}}). This value cannot be changed apart from initialization, hence the name constant, as opposed to a [variable]({{< ref "variable" >}}) of which the value can vary.

A constant can be of any [datatype]({{< ref "datatypes" >}}) and can contain a [value]({{< ref "value" >}}) according to its [datatype]({{< ref "datatypes" >}}). For example, an `integer` has whole numbers between -2^31 and +2^31-1 (e.g. 23) , a `float` has a floating point number (e.g. 2.674) and a `string` has a series of characters (e.g. "Hello World!").

There is a number of predefined constants. These variables are predefined, which means they exist without the programmer making them. They can be useful in a some functions or when assigning them to some global variables.
